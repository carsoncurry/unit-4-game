Collectors of the Stones!
Forged at the beginning of the universe, the Infinity Stones represent the greatest destructive capability in all of existence. Harnessing the very concepts of space, mind, reality, power, time and soul, these six stones have the potential to create or destroy anything when brought together. 

Worst of all, Thanos is coming. You must capture the Infinity Stones before the Mad Titan does or he will wipe out half the universe with a snap of his fingers. I, the Watcher, am unable to help you on this quest, but I can explain the rules:

At the beginning of the game you will be given a random target number. Do not stray from this specific target, as the hands of fate are a fickle thing and do not appreciate wavering!
As you can see, the six Infinity Stones lay before you. Their proximity does not mean that they are quite within reach, however…
Each time you click on a specific Infinity Stone points will be added to your score, though this will be hidden from you at first. Even one such as I do not have the ability to see all variables until they are presented!
If you can choose the correct Infinity Stones in the correct sequence of clicks, then you will wield the power cosmic allowing you to defeat Thanos!
If you fail to correctly guess the correct sequence, then Thanos will be victorious and gain the opportunity to court Mistress Death herself…
The Multiverse is an ever-changing ocean of consequence, so each time you start a new game the target number and values of each Infinity Stone will change. Push yourself to see who wins between you and Thanos in this grim dance of entropic consequence!

Note that this exercise usually calls for four "crystals" but I opted for six instead to fit the theme better. This will also slightly increase the difficulty of the game.
